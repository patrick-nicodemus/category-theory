\section{Introduction}
(March 5, 2023)

The purpose of this document is to record the progress of writing the
code in this development, talk about pain points and brainstorm about
how I would like to make my life easier.

\section{If then rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the goal contains an expression of the form $[ \mathsf{ffun
  }x \Rightarrow t] a$, rewrite (under binders or otherwise) using
  $\mathsf{ffunE}$.
\item If you have a match, try case analysis.
\item If you have an expression in the goal of the form $x - n + n$,
  try rewriting and looking for a proof that $x\geq n$.
\item If you have an expression, in your goal or in the hypothesis, of
  the form $\lnot n \leq m$, rewrite this as $m < n$.
\item If you have an expression of the form $b = \mathsf{false}$,
  rewrite this as $\lnot b$.
\item If you have $n\leq m$ and $m < n$ as hypotheses, conclude contradiction.
\end{itemize}
\section{Other kinds of possible rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item If all other options have been exhausted, try unfolding a
  constant term whose definition is unknown.
\end{itemize}
